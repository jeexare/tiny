        Doc? This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows
        in the upper forties. That's a Florence Nightingale effect. It happens
        in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it,
        kid. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television
        program, Science Fiction Theater. What about George?

        doing, Doc? Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she
